# 👋 Hi, I’m **Jonathan Elbaz**

I’m a **full-stack engineer** with a **Bachelor in Computer Science** and a **Master’s degree in Software Engineering**.
My expertise lies at the intersection of **high-performance systems** and **modern web/mobile development**:

* ⚡ **C++ / Rust** → performance-critical & constrained environments
* 🌐 **React / Next.js / Expo / TypeScript** → scalable web & mobile apps
* 🤖 **FastAPI / LangChain** → AI-driven features & LLM integration
* ☁️ **AWS / Docker / CI/CD** → cloud industrialization & DevOps
